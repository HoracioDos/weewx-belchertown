# Customized Belchertown weewx skin

This fork from [weewx-belchertown skin](https://github.com/poblabs/weewx-belchertown) have been customized mainly to change some small aspects in the layout and style. Some other modifications are related to my own needs and interests. This version was synched upstream to v1.0rc7 on April 26, 2019.

## Credits
* Thanks to Pat O'Brien for creating such a wonderful skin. 
* Also thanks to Tom Keffer and Matthew Wall for making [weewx weather software](http://weewx.com) available to everyone.
