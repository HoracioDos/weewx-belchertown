# Customized Belchertown weewx skin

This fork from [weewx-belchertown skin](https://github.com/poblabs/weewx-belchertown) have been customized mainly to change some small aesthetic aspects in the skin. It was synched upstream to v1.0rc7 on April 26, 2019.

The following features are not included in Poblabs/Belchertown skin. Most of them are simple changes in the layout and style. Some others are related to my own needs and interests.  As none of them make a meaningful difference, <u>Poblabs/Belchertown skin is all what you probably may need or want.</u>

## Credits
